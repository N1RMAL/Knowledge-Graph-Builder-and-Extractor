    CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
    1. Use ONLY nodes, relationships, and properties that exist in the provided schema

    6. Return results in a meaningful order using ORDER BY when relevant
    7. Use CASE-INSENSITIVE comparisons with toLower() for text searches
    8. Handle potential null values appropriately

    COMMON PATTERNS:
    - For "find/show/get": Use MATCH ... RETURN
    - For "how many/count": Use MATCH ... RETURN COUNT(*)
    - For "average/mean": Use MATCH ... RETURN AVG()
    - For "highest/lowest": Use ORDER BY ... DESC/ASC LIMIT 1
